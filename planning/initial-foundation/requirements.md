# Requirements: Initial Foundation

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Author:** stharrold
**Status:** Draft

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

The German language learning project needs a foundational structure to store and manage German vocabulary, grammar rules, and learning resources. This initial release establishes the basic framework for future language learning features.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Python package structure created with proper module organization
- [ ] Basic vocabulary data model implemented with gender support
- [ ] Initial vocabulary dataset (50+ words) added
- [ ] Data validation ensures German-specific linguistic features
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Documentation explains project structure and usage

### Stakeholders

- **Primary:** German language learners, developers building language tools
- **Secondary:** Contributors adding vocabulary/grammar content

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Python Package Structure

**Priority:** High
**Description:** Create a well-organized Python package that can be imported and extended

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `src/german/` package with `__init__.py`
- [ ] Submodules for vocabulary, grammar, and utils
- [ ] Package installable via `uv sync`
- [ ] Proper type hints throughout

### FR-002: Vocabulary Data Model

**Priority:** High
**Description:** Define data structures for German vocabulary with linguistic metadata

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Support for grammatical gender (der/die/das)
- [ ] Plural forms for nouns
- [ ] English translations
- [ ] Part of speech tagging
- [ ] Pydantic models for validation

### FR-003: Initial Vocabulary Dataset

**Priority:** High
**Description:** Provide foundational vocabulary dataset with common German words

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] At least 50 German words
- [ ] Mix of nouns, verbs, adjectives
- [ ] Stored in structured JSON format
- [ ] Validated against schema
- [ ] UTF-8 encoding with proper umlauts

### FR-004: Vocabulary Loader

**Priority:** High
**Description:** Utility to load and validate vocabulary data from JSON files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Load vocabulary from `resources/vocabulary/`
- [ ] Validate data against Pydantic models
- [ ] Handle encoding correctly (ä, ö, ü, ß)
- [ ] Error messages for invalid data
- [ ] Type-safe API

### FR-005: Basic Query Functions

**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Simple functions to query vocabulary

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Get word by German term
- [ ] Filter by part of speech
- [ ] Filter by gender (for nouns)
- [ ] Return typed objects

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Not critical for initial release
- Should load vocabulary dataset in < 100ms

### Security

- No authentication required (local library)
- Input validation via Pydantic models
- No external network calls

### Scalability

- Initial design should support 1000+ vocabulary words
- File-based storage acceptable for v1.0.0
- Architecture allows future database migration

### Reliability

- All data files must be UTF-8 encoded
- Validation prevents invalid data from loading
- Graceful error handling with informative messages

### Maintainability

- Code coverage: ≥ 80%
- Type hints for all public APIs
- Docstrings with examples
- README with usage instructions

## Constraints

### Technology

- Python 3.11+
- uv for package management
- JSON for data storage (v1.0.0)
- Pydantic for validation
- pytest for testing

### Timeline

- Target: First release (v1.0.0)
- Scope: Foundational structure only

### Dependencies

- Minimal external dependencies
- No database required for v1.0.0
- No web framework for v1.0.0

## Out of Scope

- Web interface (future)
- Database storage (future)
- Audio pronunciation (future)
- Flashcard system (future)
- Grammar exercises (future)
- User accounts (future)

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Encoding issues with umlauts | Medium | High | Use UTF-8 everywhere, test thoroughly |
| Incomplete linguistic metadata | Low | Medium | Start simple, expand in future releases |
| Test data quality | Low | Medium | Manual review, cite sources |

## Data Requirements

### Data Entities

**Vocabulary Word:**
- German word (string)
- English translation (string)
- Part of speech (enum: noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Grammatical gender (enum: masculine, feminine, neuter) - nouns only
- Plural form (string) - nouns only

### Data Volume

- Initial: 50-100 words
- Target: Support for 1000+ words

### Data Retention

- All vocabulary data versioned in git
- No automatic cleanup

## User Stories

### As a developer, I want to import the German vocabulary library so that I can build language learning tools

**Scenario 1:** Import and use vocabulary
- Given the package is installed
- When I import `from german.vocabulary import load_vocabulary`
- Then I can load and query vocabulary data

### As a content contributor, I want to add new vocabulary words so that the dataset grows

**Scenario 1:** Add new word
- Given I have a JSON file with vocabulary
- When I follow the schema format
- Then the loader validates and accepts the word

**Scenario 2:** Invalid data rejected
- Given I have a noun without gender
- When I try to load the vocabulary
- Then I get a clear validation error

## Assumptions

- Users have Python 3.11+ installed
- Users are familiar with basic Python imports
- Data files are edited with UTF-8 capable editors
- Initial dataset will be curated by maintainers

## Questions and Open Issues

- [ ] Should we include example sentences in v1.0.0?
- [ ] What citation format for vocabulary sources?
- [ ] Include pronunciation guides (IPA)?

## Approval

- [ ] Product Owner review
- [ ] Technical Lead review
- [ ] Ready for implementation
